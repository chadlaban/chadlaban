**`Digital Ambivert (Software Developer/Photographer/Home Cook/Curious Mind)`**

I'm just a human being that has high interest with web development. I love photography, food, and any ideas that's outside the box, I love to expressing my creativity through my projects and how I dress up. I enjoy seeing projects grow from just ideas to actual design and code.

### :space_invader: What keeps me motivated?

When I started coding, things can be quite overwhelming, sometimes I get so many ideas that I want to create but don't get the results or output that I want. What keeps me going is that I think of why I started the idea, why I started to create it, what made me think of doing it, and what can I benefit from it on the long run. Also, I always make sure that I have time to breath and enjoy the little things outside of a project that I'm working on. I have a few qoutes that I always stand by (I know cringe... hahaha!) which is:
<br />
<br />
"Be many things, a tasty sandwich isn't just a piece of bread."
<br />
and
<br />
"Walk in your own path, but pick up something good along the way."
<br />

 <summary><h3>:walking: Chad's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started studying for a medical degree during my time at the university and had a computer subject that really peaked my interest and was challenging for me in a good way. I shifted my study from a medical degree to Information Technology, it was fun and at the same time challenging for me but in every requirement that I have accomplished brought genuine happiness. I landed my first tech job on my hometown as an analyst then transition to a software developer role, from then on I felt compelled to create or know more about web development, I then started to shift into a front-end developer role on another company as a warm up for me to test the waters. After a few months working on a contract project, my interest piqued and wanted to learn more about back-end development. As my interest keeps changing I always make sure that whatever job I apply in has something that can be beneficial for me on the future, and I always make time to learn more about other modern web development technologies being used now a days. Learning does not stop and is free in our industry...
   
   <br />that's why I like coding, not only because there's always something new to learn about it, but because there's always a place for someone on the industry.
