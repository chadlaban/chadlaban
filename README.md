**`Software Developer / Web Developer / Photographer / Home Cook / Gamer / Peacemaker`**

I'm just someone that likes doing anything with web development, from converting a UI/UX design into fully functioning software products. I love photography, food, and any ideas that's outside the box. I love to express my creativity through whatever I'm currently doing, whether customizing a character on a game or even adding a wine on my pasta.

### :space_invader: What keeps me motivated?

When I started coding, things can be quite overwhelming, sometimes I get so many ideas that I want to create but don't get the results or output that I want. What keeps me going is that I think of why I started the idea, why I started to create it, what made me think of doing it, and what can I benefit from it on the long run. Also, I always make sure that I have time to breath and enjoy the little things outside of a project that I'm working on (because I work to live, not live to work).

 <summary><h3>:walking: Chad's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started studying for a medical degree during my time at the university and had a computer subject that really peaked my interest and was challenging for me in a good way. I shifted my study from a medical degree to Information Technology, it was fun and at the same time challenging for me. I landed my first tech job on my hometown as an analyst then transition to a software developer role, from then on I felt compelled to create or know more about web development, I then started to shift into a front-end developer role on another company as a warm up for me to test the waters. Just a few months I already realized that I like what I'm doing and that I'm always open to new things whether it's about front-end development or back-end development, even though it can be a bit tough especially if you're new to a technology, but it just becomes a part of what you already know because some concepts are just similar to what you already have or have done.
