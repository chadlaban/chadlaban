**`Software Developer / Web Developer / Photographer / Home Cook / Gamer / Peacemaker`**

I'm just someone that likes doing anything with web development, from converting a UI/UX design into fully functioning software products. I love photography, food, and any ideas that's outside the box. I love to express my creativity through whatever I'm currently doing, whether customizing a character on a game or even adding a wine on my pasta.

### :space_invader: What keeps me motivated?

When I began coding, it was completely something I did not know and because of that I was easily overwhelmed and frustrated, then I spiralled into complete insanity (JK.. haha). What keeps me motivated is remembering that I have free will to do things slow, to learn things step-by-step, and to reach out or check into the dev community; also recalling why I even started a project and what can I gain along the way. I also make sure to take breaks and enjoy the little things outside of work.

 <summary><h3>:walking: Chad's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I initially pursued a medical degree at university but found my passion in a computer subject. I switched to Information Technology, which was both fun and challenging. I started my tech career as an analyst in my hometown, then transitioned to a software developer role. This sparked my interest in web development, leading me to a front-end developer role at another company. I quickly realized my love for both front-end and back-end development, embracing new technologies and concepts along the way.
